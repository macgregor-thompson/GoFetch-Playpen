                            Many people think that websites are too costly and you can't afford them.
                            The truth is you can't afford NOT to have a website.
                            Compared to costs associated with other
                            avenues of marketing such as magazine or newspaper ads, and the near limitless market you can reach,
                            it can have a hugely beneficial impact on your return on investment.

                            A website can cut out a tremendous
                            amount of the time it takes to inform people in your targeted audience
                            about a new product, a new promotion, or if you're just getting started and are ready to find customers.
                            Once your custom built website is up and running you can get everything you need to your customers in one
                            simple place accessible on just about any device.

                            The cost of a website varies, but once it is staged it generally costs less than $100 per month and as little as $15.  Compared to the costs associated with other
                            avenues of marketing such as magazine or newspaper ads, and the near limitless market you can reach, it can have a hugely beneficial impact on your return on investment.

                            Spreading the right information to your customers can take a long time. A website can cut out a tremendous amount of the time it takes to inform people in your targeted audience
                            about a new product, a new promotion, or if you're just getting started and are ready to find customers.  It helps reduce all the phone calls, brochures,
                            emails, and face-to-face meetings associated with getting your name or business name out there.
                            Once your custom built website is up and running you can get everything you need to your customers in one simple place accessible on just about any device.

                        <p>
                            Many people think that websites are too costly and you can't afford them. The truth is you can't afford NOT to have a website.
                            The cost of a website varies, but once it is staged it generally costs less than $100 per month and as little as $15.  Compared to the costs associated with other
                            avenues of marketing such as magazine or newspaper ads, and the near limitless market you can reach, it can have a hugely beneficial impact on your return on investment.

                        <p>
                            Spreading the right information to your customers can take a long time. A website can cut out a tremendous amount of the time it takes to inform people in your targeted audience
                            about a new product, a new promotion, or if you're just getting started and are ready to find customers.  It helps reduce all the phone calls, brochures,
                            emails, and face-to-face meetings associated with getting your name or business name out there.
                            Once your custom built website is up and running you can get everything you need to your customers in one simple place accessible on just about any device.

                            Spreading the right information to your customers can take a long time. A website can cut out a tremendous amount of the time it takes to inform people in your targeted audience
                            about a new product, a new promotion, or if you're just getting started and are ready to find customers.  It helps reduce all the phone calls, brochures,
                            emails, and face-to-face meetings associated with getting your name or business name out there.
                            Once your custom built website is up and running you can get everything you need to your customers in one simple place accessible on just about any device.

                            By listing pictures and information about yourself and/or your business as well as the products and services you are selling, you can really show off your work
                            and how you differ from other similar businesses out there.  Using things like customer testimonials, a FAQ page, or an image or video gallery, you can really start
